# ReadMe-Generator

An application that allows the user to generate a README file from the command prompt. 
## Overview
 This is the 9th solo challenge of my bootcamp in Front-End Web Development. I have been able to demonstrate basic concepts of Node.js in this challenge.

## Description
This challenge involved writing javascript using Node modules such as File System and Inquirer. It allows the user to generate a README file from the command prompt by answering a set of questions, the responses of which are written into a newly created README.md file. This is so that they can focus on high priority tasks of their project.

## Credits

Study groups with Davou Jobbi, Andrea Fontana, Ioana Iosub, Thomas Jack, Lauren Eaton, Laura Kane held to help understand, troubleshoot and debug each others code.

Research on websites including W3Schools, MDN web docs and FreeCodeCamp viewing samples of code to help understand new syntax and commands that we have learnt in Node.js

## Features

This is a collection of javascript code that uses Node Modules such as File System and Inquirer, template literals, if/else statements, functions, and other JS features to create a README file generator.
